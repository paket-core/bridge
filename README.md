PAKET Bridge Server
===================

The PAKET Bridge Server is a centralized server which provides a bridge between
mobile and Web apps and the Stellar network, in addition to some rudimentary
routing capabilities.

To deploy, test, and run the server, use [the PAKET manager](/paket-core/manager).
